### Overview
The objective of this project was to create a tidy data set which utilize data collected from a study completed by Smartlab - Non Linear Complete Systems Laboratory related to Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset.  A full description of the data used to build this tidy data set can be found at:

# Project Objectives:
  1.  Merge the training and the test sets to reate one data set.
  2.  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3.  Use descriptive activty names to name the activites in teh data set
  4.  Approprately label the data set with descriptive variables names
  5.  From the data set in step 4, create a second, independant tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Notes about my code:
 * Update the working directory to reflect your path
 * If you run this in R-Studio the table created at the end of each step will be displayed for review
 
 Additional Details about around this code can be obtained by reading the CodeBook.MD
